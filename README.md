### LECTURE 1: ALGORITHM AND COMPUTATION
In this lecture, i revised the **big O notation**, where i know how to represent a algorithm by $\Theta$ or $
O$ or $\Omega$.

### ASSIGNMENT 0
I installed Latex and equipe Vscode with it. I learned the grammar of Latex, which is a bit complex.

### LECTURE 2: DATA STRUCTURE AND DYNAMIC ARRAYS
This lecture, i learned something new: 
- **Sequence Interface and Set Interface**: Interface ddefines a collection of operations (API or ADT), which gives me a new point of view.
- Amortized time, which is used by the `resize()` of dynamic-array.
I also revised three data structures: static-array, linked-list and dynamic-array.

### LECTURE 3: SETS AND SORTING
I revised three sorts: selection sort, insertion sort and merge sort. I have a great impression on selection
sort and insertion sort now. Selection sort is implemented in *exercices/sorts.py*, which performs fewer swaps.
Insertion sort performs better when the data is basiclly sorted. There is a case related in Problem 2-2.

### ASSIGNMENT 1
Calculate a bunch of time complexity and write a double-linked list, which is easy.

### LECTURE 4:  HASHING
I learned how to prove the lower bound of a find operation based on **a comparative model** is $\Omega(log_2n)$.
I also touch a new way of choosing hash function: **Universal Hash**. The probability of collision can be 
controlled tight: $\mathop{Pr}_{h\in \mathbb{H}}\{h(k_i)=h(k_j)\}\le 1/m\quad \forall k_i\ne k_j\in \{0,...,u-1\}$

### ASSIGNMENT 2
I learned how to draw a tree in Latex, which is hard though.

*2023.09.13*

### LECTURE 5: LINEAR SORTING
I learned bucket sort, count sort(which is a kind of bucket sort, but enable us to store replicated items) and
radix sort. This is fantastic. In a comparative model, the lower bound of sort is definitely $\Omega(nlogn)$.
But use these three sorts, time complexity reaches $O(n)$.

### ASSIGNMEN 3
I learned how to draw a hash table in Latex. Be more familiar with Linear sorts.

*2023.09.14*

### LECTURE 6: BINARY TREES, PART 1, PART 2: AVL
I have already learned. As consequence, nothing here.
